# Robotics software engineer nanodegree

This repository contains projects for the robotics software engineer nanodegree program by Udacity. It is mostly written in C++, and uses Gazebo and ROS to drive a robot through an simulated environment.

* Project 1 is just setting up a gazebo world
* Project 2 is setting up a robot in that world that can follow a ball using the camera sensor. The ball is manually moved by the mouse to control the robot.
* Project 3 uses adaptative monte carlo localization (AMCL) to locate the robot inside an environment.
